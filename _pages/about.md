I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science. Currently, I am interested in the following areas: **dynamic graph algorithms** and **combinatorial optimization**. If you have any interesting questions or better ideas related to my research topics, feel free to reach out to me anytime!

<h1>Research Experience</h1>
I had a wonderful research visit at UMich in spring 2023, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/).
