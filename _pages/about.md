I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science,  currently I am interested in graph algorithms and design, but I also have a strong interest in game theory and cryptography. I warmly welcome anyone with similar interests to get in touch with me.

<h1>Research Experience</h1>
I had a wonderful research visit at UMich in spring 2023, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/).

<h1>News</h1>
Recently, I am interested in the following concrete directions:
[Maximum Flow by Augmenting Paths in n^{2+o(1) Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03648)

[Faster Min-Plus Product for Monotone Instances](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04500)

[Spetral and Algebraic Graph Theory](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sagt/sagt.pdf)
