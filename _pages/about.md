I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. where my research interests broadly focus on theoretical computer science, particularly in dynamic graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization. I had a wonderful research visit at the University of Michigan in the spring of 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/). I am also grateful to my undergraduate advisor, [Ran Duan](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/duanr/), for his guidance and support throughout my academic journey. If you have any interesting questions or ideas related to my research areas, feel free to reach out anytime!



<h1>One more thing</h1>
"We are fortunate to live in an era of rapid development in computer science, where we can contribute our wisdom to its growth." The field of computer science is advancing at an astonishing pace, and research that was on the cutting edge just 20 years ago has now become textbook material. This is why I firmly believe in the importance of lifelong learning, continuous progress, and keeping an open mind. Only through constant learning and maintaining curiosity can we continue to move forward in this fast-evolving field and contribute our own part to its growth.
