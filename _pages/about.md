I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, especially those related to the design and analysis of algorithms. And I had a wonderful research visit at UMich, advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/)
