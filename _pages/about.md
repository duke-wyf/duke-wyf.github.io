I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science,  currently I am interested in graph algorithms and design, but I also have a strong interest in game theory and cryptography. I warmly welcome anyone with similar interests to get in touch with me.

<h1>Research Experience</h1>
I had a wonderful research visit at UMich in spring 2023, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/).

<h1>News</h1>
Recently, I am interested in the following concrete directions:

1. Learn new max flow techniques
[Maximum Flow by Augmenting Paths in n^{2+o(1)} Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03648)

2. Learn techniques for min-plus product
[Faster Min-Plus Product for Monotone Instances](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.04500)

3. Learn some classic tools in graph theory
[Spetral and Algebraic Graph Theory](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/sagt/sagt.pdf)

One more thing!
Graph Isomorphism (GI) is a problem that has puzzled computer scientists for a long time. I remember learning about this problem in a graph theory book when I was in high school. GI is one of the few problems that lie between P and NP, with P ⊆ GI ⊆ NP. I believe that this problem is very helpful for our research on symmetry in graph theory. I believe that with the development of mathematics and computer science, this problem no longer seems as difficult as it did 20 years ago. This is one of the issues I am most concerned about right now, and I hope that through this problem, we can gain insights into the relationship between P and NP.
