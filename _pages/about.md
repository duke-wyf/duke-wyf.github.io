I am an incoming first-year Ph.D. student at Duke University, broadly interested in theoretical computer scienceâ€”especially dynamic graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization.

I recently graduated from the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University.  In the spring of 2023, I had the pleasure of visiting the University of Michigan, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/). I am also deeply grateful to my undergraduate advisor, [Ran Duan](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/duanr/),  for his continuous guidance and support throughout my academic journey.

If you have any interesting questions or ideas related to my research areas, feel free to reach out anytime!

<h1>One more thing</h1>
"We are fortunate to live in an era of rapid development in computer science, where we can contribute our wisdom to its growth." The field of computer science is advancing at an astonishing pace, and research just 10 years ago has now become textbook material. This is why I firmly believe in the importance of lifelong learning, continuous progress, and keeping an open mind. Only through constant learning and maintaining curiosity can we continue to move forward in this fast-evolving field and contribute our own part to its growth.
