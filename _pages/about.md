I am currently a senior student at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS, aka. Yao Class)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science,  currently I am interested in graph algorithms and design, but I also have a strong interest in game theory and cryptography. I warmly welcome anyone with similar interests to get in touch with me.

<h1>Research Experience</h1>
I had a wonderful research visit at UMich in spring 2023, and I was fortunate to be advised by [Thatchaphol Saranurak](https://sites.google.com/site/thsaranurak/).
